This repository includes a modified A1 python program(a1.py), damping_Time.py to find the damping time of the system and the best vibration absorber.<br>
A modified matlab program(a1.m) that computes the natural frequency and mode shapes of 3 degree of freedom is also attached.<br>
A1(m code)data (version 1).xlsx contains the experimental results
